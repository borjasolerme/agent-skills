# Voice Samples

This file teaches the agent to mimic your natural Reddit writing style. Filling it out is optional — the skill works fine without it, but comments will feel more "you" with it.

## How to Find Your Comments

1. Go to your Reddit profile → **Comments** tab
2. Copy 8-10 of your best comments (ones that got upvotes or felt natural)
3. Paste them below, separated by `---`
4. Minimum: 5 comments, each 30+ words

## Voice Analysis

<!--
DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION MANUALLY.
After you paste comments above and ask the agent to "learn my style",
it will analyze your samples and write a summary here covering:
- Typical comment length
- Common phrases and filler words
- Structural preferences (paragraph style, list usage, question placement)
- Tone markers (humor, directness, hedging)
- Capitalization and punctuation habits

This analysis is what gets used during draft generation — the agent reads
this section, not the raw samples, to save tokens.
