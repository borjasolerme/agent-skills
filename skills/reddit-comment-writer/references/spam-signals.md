## The 90/10 Rule

Reddit's core principle: "It's perfectly fine to be a Redditor with a website; it's not okay to be a website with a Reddit account."

- 90% of all activity must be genuine, non-promotional engagement
- 10% maximum can include product mentions
- Calculated across your entire account history, not per thread
- Some communities enforce an even stricter ratio

## Spam Signals to Avoid

### Account-Level Red Flags

| Signal | Why it triggers |
|---|---|
| New account + immediate promotion | Accounts under 30 days are heavily scrutinized |
| Low karma + product mentions | Most subs require 10-50+ karma to post |
| Every comment mentions same product | Mods check comment history |
| Single-domain link history | Repeatedly linking same URL triggers spam filters |
| Robotic posting schedule | Same time every day signals automation |

### Comment-Level Red Flags

| Signal | Why it triggers |
|---|---|
| Link-dropping without context | Fastest way to get flagged |
| Copy-pasted identical comments | Fast route to shadowban |
| Forcing product into unrelated threads | Obvious shoehorning |
| Buried disclosure | "I work here" at the very end instead of upfront |
| Editing posts to add links after engagement | Bait-and-switch detected by mods |
| "Nice! We can help with this - [link]" | Generic low-value + promo combo |
| Hard-sell pitch language | Reads like a sales script |

### Language Red Flags

These words and patterns immediately signal "marketing" to Reddit users:

**Words to never use:**
- "industry-leading", "revolutionary", "game-changing"
- "leverage the power of", "maximize your ROI"
- "this resonates hard" (known AI slop signal)
- "absolutely" as an intensifier
- any emoji-heavy formatting

**Formatting that signals AI slop (identified by Reddit users):**
- Em dash on every sentence
- Excessive bullet points
- "Quotes" around random words
- Very polite salesman-style tone
- Overly structured with headers/bold in comments

**What real Reddit users said about spotting spam:**
- "I can smell AI slop from a kilometre away. Dashes on every sentence, pointers, quotes, very polite salesman type post"
- "The long value-packed replies that somehow always loop back to someone's product are really exhausting"
- "This is the pattern of every comment here" (referring to fake value + product pitch)

## Anti-Patterns: Real Examples That Failed (Scraped from Reddit)

### The AI Slop Response (0 upvotes, r/SaaS)
```
Wow, first off, huge congratulations on launching your SaaS! I know that sounds like the obvious thing to say, but I don't think it really captures what an achievement that actually is. Building anything that people can use, that just works reliably enough to feel like it belongs in their workflow, is already a monumental feat. The sheer number of moving parts...
```
Why it fails: over-the-top praise, no substance, reads like ChatGPT output. Users replied "Nice ChatGPT."

### The Stealth Promo (0 upvotes, r/SaaS)
```
I've had some luck finding actual conversations by using [product] to filter out the noise and only surface posts where people are genuinely asking for help in my niche.
```
Why it fails: disguised as a casual user tip but is clearly promoting. Thread was about Reddit spam — the irony wasn't lost on anyone.

### The Coordinated Recommendation (r/smallbusiness, multiple 1-upvote comments)
Four different accounts in the same payroll thread all recommending the exact same two tools in near-identical phrasing:
- "You might check out [tool-a] or [tool-b]..."
- "I'd check out [tool-a] or [tool-b] for all in one HR..."
- "You might want to check out [tool-a] or [tool-b] both are solid..."
- "Either of [tool-a] or [tool-b] would work from what I know..."
Reddit users and mods spot coordinated patterns immediately.

### The Referral Link Drop (r/smallbusiness, low upvotes)
```
So true! This is the biggest reason we have loved [tool] so much. We changed back in 2019 and have grown tenfold since... Plus anyone who wants to check it out can get up to a $300 gift card just for running a test payroll - just sign up here [referral-link]
```
Why it fails: starts genuine but the referral link turns it into a sales pitch. Mixes honest experience with affiliate incentive.

### The "Value Post" That's Actually an Ad (r/AI_Agents, called out with 22 upvotes)
A 1.3K-upvote post about "building 50+ AI agents" that twice name-dropped a specific coding tool as a "lifesaver." Community response:
- "Yea seems like the OP is an ai promo for whatever [tool] is" (22 upvotes)
- "That's exactly what's going on. I bet the original post was by a [company] agent" (4 upvotes)
- "No offence but this post just reeks of AI bots talking to each other" (30 upvotes)

### How Users Detect AI/Spam Comments (real 8-upvote explanation)
```
Short paragraphs, seems to pick out just a couple of components on the original post and gives vague-sounding generic sort of comments on it. Then ends with final question paragraph thats almost a word for word copy of the op. Note they include a link to something that will almost certainly lead to whatever they are trying to sell you. Also there are NO replies from the OP in here.
```

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
- Build karma first (2-4 weeks of genuine engagement, target 100+ karma)
- Lead with 200+ words of genuine advice before any mention
- Use the sandwich: value first, transparent mention, more value
- Mention 1-2 competitor tools alongside yours for objectivity
- Write casually: contractions, lowercase, personal anecdotes, mention downsides
- Include specific details: metrics, timelines, real experiences
- Comment on posts 1-4 hours old that are gaining traction
- Vary posting times, subreddits, and contribution types
- Disclose affiliation upfront: "full disclosure: I'm the founder of [X]"
- Only respond when the product genuinely fits the question

### Don't:
- Drop links without context
- Copy-paste the same reply across threads
- Promote before building credibility
- Use marketing language
- Post only self-promotional content
- Force product mentions into unrelated discussions
- Link to your domain in early comments (story-driven expertise is safer)
- Use urgent/hype language
- Delete comments when called out (looks suspicious)
- Argue with moderators

## If You Get Called Out

1. Acknowledge the concern respectfully
2. Do not get defensive
3. Provide additional value with zero promotion
4. Do not delete the comment (looks suspicious)
5. Accept the feedback and move on
