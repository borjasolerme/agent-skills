# Comment Angles

Five proven angles for writing Reddit comments. Each angle includes the strategy, a real-world pattern, and anonymized examples.

Pick the angle that best fits the thread. If none fit naturally, skip the product mention entirely and just add value.

---

## 1. The Helper

**Strategy:** Directly answer the person's question with specific, actionable advice. Mention the product as one option among 2-3 alternatives.

**When to use:** Someone is asking "how do I..." or "what tool should I use for..."

**Pattern:**
- Diagnose their specific problem first
- Give actionable advice that works without your product
- Mention your product as one of several options
- End with a question

**Example A:**
```
which is the main problem for you? the script? to make the avatar realistic?

to make the avatar realistic you can use [tool-a] ai model, quite good. for the script the best thing is giving 5 example of working scripts, you can download tiktok videos get the transcript from them and paste them as example to chatgpt.

if you don't want to worry about anything of that, i would say one of the best tools i've found is [your-product]
```

**Example B (real pattern from a form-builder founder):**
```
hey, have you tried [your-product]? we have a very generous free tier that includes file uploads

if you have any other questions about it, happy to help
```

Why B works: only responds when the product directly solves the stated problem. Short, specific, no hard sell.

**Example C (real pattern from a spend-management thread):**
```
for long-term spend tracking with team uploads + auto-categorization, i'd suggest:

- [tool-a] - lets employees upload receipts, auto-tags by category
- [tool-b] - great for growing teams, real-time spend visibility
- [tool-c] - customizable, works well if you're already in their ecosystem

if you want something simpler, i built [your-product] recently for a client - works surprisingly well and has zero monthly cost. happy to share the setup if you're curious
```

Why C works: leads with 3 established tools, each with a specific reason. Own product comes last as a lighter alternative.

## 2. The Tool List

**Strategy:** Share a curated list of tools for a use case. Include your product as one item in a list of 4-6+ tools.

**When to use:** Someone asks for recommendations, "what's your stack", or "best tools for X"

**Pattern:**
- List 4-6 tools with brief descriptions
- Your product gets the same space as others (not more)
- Each tool has a specific use case, not generic praise
- Optional: frame the list as data-driven or experience-based

**Example A:**
```
my list:

- Customer support: [tool-a]
- Sales and getting leads: [tool-b]
- Video ads: [your-product]
- Coding webapps: [tool-c]
- Coding mobile apps: [tool-d]
- Building internal tools: [tool-e]
```

**Example B:**
```
at the end small business don't have time to use more tools, it is only going to work if the tool does "everything for them", so here I would go with AI tools

examples:
- chat support: [tool-a]
- automations with [tool-b] or [tool-c]
- video ads: [your-product]
```

**Example C (real pattern from an AI agents thread):**
```
great roundup, tons of practical examples here. one thing i've seen work really well that isn't often talked about is using AI for [specific-use-case]

most teams still waste hours on [manual-process] and if you can streamline that with AI, you save a ton of time

i've built a product in this space and happy to share more
```

Why C works: adds a new angle not covered in the original post, discloses affiliation, offers passively ("happy to share more") instead of pushing.

---

## 3. The Experience Share

**Strategy:** Tell a brief personal story about solving a problem. The product comes up naturally as part of the story.

**When to use:** Someone shares a struggle you've dealt with. Works best when you can include specific numbers or results.

**Pattern:**
- Relate to their situation with a personal anecdote
- Share what worked (and what didn't)
- Product mention feels like context, not a pitch
- Include specific details (metrics, timelines, quirks)

**Example A:**
```
only issue I see that once you externalize you can't control it.

They will own you because they know everything and if they are late with work or bad you can only change agency and start again the process

for me is always better to have things internal in the company
```

Note: this example has NO product mention at all. Sometimes the best play is pure value.

**Example B (real pattern from a SaaS SEO thread):**
```
we learned it the hard way - when we launched our onboarding flow, we saw a 38% drop-off between steps 1 and 2

what fixed it was [specific actionable advice]. i ended up building [your-product] for this, but honestly the bigger win was just simplifying the flow itself
```

Why B works: leads with a specific failure + real metric. The product mention is framed as a byproduct, not the hero of the story.

**Example C (real pattern from an AI agents discussion):**
```
can 100% vouch for this. been building agents for mid-size clients and the ones that actually stick are dead simple

we built one that just scans internal slack channels for bug reports and dumps them into jira, that's it. zero llm reasoning, zero fancy logic

but it saves 4-5 hours/week and they love it

wrote up some of the patterns we've seen in production if anyone's curious
```

Why C works: specific example with real numbers (4-5 hours/week). Link to more info is framed as optional. Ends with an invitation, not a push.

## 4. The Follow-up Question

**Strategy:** Engage genuinely with the thread by asking a thoughtful question. Product mention only if directly relevant, otherwise skip it entirely.

**When to use:** You want to build presence in a community without being promotional. Or when the thread doesn't naturally fit a product mention.

**Pattern:**
- Acknowledge something specific from the post
- Add a brief insight or opinion
- Ask a genuine question that keeps the conversation going
- Product mention is optional and minimal

**Example A:**
```
i would say that it still needs a bit of improvement, like a music in the background and some sound effects

but if you are new to it, is a good start

which tool did you use for the avatars? [tool-a], [tool-b], [tool-c], [your-product]?
```

**Example B:**
```
Has anyone ever experimented with a price plan to try the app for $1?

Instead of having a free trial, we are going to test to ask for 1 euro

I've seen [well-known-tool] has something similar to it.
```

**Example C:**
```
interesting approach. how are you handling [specific-technical-detail]?

we ran into something similar and found that [brief-insight]

curious what other approaches folks here have tried
```

---

## 5. The Contrarian Take

**Strategy:** Offer a different perspective that challenges the consensus. Product mention only as supporting evidence, if at all.

**When to use:** The thread is heading in a direction you disagree with based on real experience. Works best when you have data or a concrete story to back it up.

**Pattern:**
- Respectfully challenge the common view
- Back it up with experience or data
- Product mention is optional and secondary to the argument
- Invites discussion rather than being preachy

**Example A:**
```
unpopular opinion but i think [common approach] is actually overkill for most use cases

we tried it for 3 months and switched to [simpler approach] - saved us 10 hours/week and the results were basically the same

sometimes the boring solution is the right one
```

**Example B:**
```
honestly i disagree with most of the advice here. most people saying "just use [popular-tool]" haven't tried the alternatives

we tested 4 different options and [your-product] actually performed better for our specific use case because [specific-reason]

but it really depends on what you need - what's your main priority?
```

**Example C (real pattern from a CEO in a payroll thread):**
```
i am obviously biased as the CEO of [your-product] but honestly any top 10 provider should be able to handle what you mention above

explicitly ask about their support - can you call, what the wait time is like etc.
```

Why C works: radical transparency ("obviously biased"). Then gives universal advice instead of pushing their own product. By saying "any top 10 provider" works, the CEO appears more trustworthy. The product name gets planted without any hard sell.

## Real Comments From Reddit (Scraped & Anonymized)

### Good Comments (upvoted, authentic)

**Helper angle — r/smallbusiness "Best payroll software?" (14 upvotes):**
```
once you have employees the big upgrade you need is using a software that also handles payroll/tax filings and benefits in one spot instead of having two separate softwares for each. that'll fix the manual edits in multiple systems and cut costs from having an accountant and a payroll software that doesn't work. i'd recommend [tool-a] in this case for both payroll and benefits
```
Why it works: directly addresses the OP's pain (multiple systems, manual edits). Recommends one specific tool with a clear reason.

**Helper angle — r/smallbusiness (4 upvotes):**
```
do you have a CPA/accountant? if so, ask them what they prefer. that way, if you need help, they can troubleshoot with you. my CPA is most familiar with [tool-a], so that's what i use. i'm sure there is better software out there, but i don't have time to learn it all either!
```
Why it works: gives practical meta-advice (ask your accountant) instead of just pushing a tool. Honest about limitations.

**Experience share angle — r/AI_Agents (71 upvotes):**
```
can 100% vouch for this. been building agents for mid-size clients and the ones that actually stick are dead simple.

we built one that just scans internal slack channels for bug reports and dumps them into jira, that's it. zero LLM reasoning, zero fancy logic. but it saves 4-5 PM hours/week and they love it.

also agree the post-launch babysitting is the real job. clients don't want to hear about "agents," they want to not hire another ops person.

wrote up some of the patterns we've seen in production if anyone's curious

curious what other "dumb-but-effective" agents folks here have shipped, always looking for new pain points to solve.
```
Why it works: specific example, real numbers, ends with genuine question. 71 upvotes. Link is passive ("if anyone's curious").

**Follow-up question angle — r/AI_Agents (4 upvotes):**
```
just a question: what platform or type of platform do you recommend for this? no-code platforms to just get it done or do you use open ai sdks for more control?
```
Why it works: genuine curiosity, no product mention at all. Builds presence through participation.

**Contrarian angle — r/smallbusiness CEO (1 upvote but high trust):**
```
i am obviously biased as the CEO of [company] but honestly any top 10 provider should be able to handle what you mention above. explicitly ask about their support - can you call, what the wait time is like etc.
```
Why it works: admits bias upfront, then gives advice that DOESN'T push their own product.

**Tool list with context — r/AI_Agents (10 upvotes):**
```
it depends on the stage you're at. for quick validation and getting something live fast, no-code tools like n8n, zapier, make are perfect. once you've got proof it will save time/money, then move to openai sdks or custom stack, it gives you way more control, flexibility, and reliability. most of the agents i've seen start in no-code and then get rebuilt with code.
```
Why it works: doesn't just list tools, provides a framework for choosing. Stage-based advice feels genuinely helpful.

### Bad Comments (called out as spam)

**The AI slop response (0 upvotes, called out):**
```
Wow, first off, huge congratulations on launching your SaaS! I know that sounds like the obvious thing to say, but I don't think it really captures what an achievement that actually is. Building anything that people can use, that just works reliably enough to feel like it belongs in their workflow, is already a monumental feat...
```
Why it fails: overly enthusiastic, corporate tone, no real content, reads like ChatGPT output.

**The stealth promo (0 upvotes):**
```
I've had some luck finding actual conversations by using [product-name] to filter out the noise and only surface posts where people are genuinely asking for help in my niche.
```
Why it fails: pretends to be a casual user but is clearly promoting. No real value beyond the plug.

**The "this resonates" opener (called out by 12-upvote comment):**
Any comment starting with "This resonates hard" or "Absolutely love this" is immediately flagged by the community as AI-generated engagement farming.

### How Reddit Users Spot Spam (from real 27-upvote comment)

```
i can smell ai slop post kilometre away.

dash on every sentence

pointers

"quotes"

very polite and sales man type post

very irritating to read.
```
